      <p>Chin surgery, also known as mentoplasty, is a surgical procedure to reshape the chin.This is done with an implant. Chin surgery may be recommended to a patient having nose surgery in order to achieve facial proportion, since the size of the chin may magnify or minimize the perceived size of the nose. Chin surgery helps provide a harmonious balance to your facial features. Additionally, cheek implants may be placed in conjunction with another cosmetic procedure, such as a face lift, forehead lift, nose surgery or eyelid surgery.</p>
