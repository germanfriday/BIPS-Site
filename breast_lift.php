                <p>A breast lift, or mastopexy, is a surgical procedure that raises and reshapes sagging breasts. Pregnancy, nursing, and the force of gravity take their toll on a woman's breasts over time. As the skin loses its elasticity, the breasts often lose their shape and firmness and begin to sag. Mastopexy can also reduce the size of the areola, the darker skin surrounding the nipple. An implant can be placed at the same time.</p>
