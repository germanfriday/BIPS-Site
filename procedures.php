      <p>Whether you have considered a plastic surgery procedure for years, or your interest is more recent, the staff of Birmingham Institute of Plastic Surgery understands that making the decision to undergo a procedure is not one taken lightly.</p>

<p>As with every surgical procedure, successful plastic surgery depends on many factors, the most important of which is your surgeon's skill and experience. For more than 30 years, William J. Vasileff, M.D., has performed proven, highly-predictable techniques that provide the best results for rejuvenation and cosmetic enhancement for his patients.</p>

<p>To help you better explore your options, we are pleased to offer basic information regarding the procedures we perform in either our office at 525 Southfield Road in Birmingham or in the safe and sterile environment of <a href="http://www.truvistasurgerycenter.com" onclick="window.open(this.href); return false;">Truvista Surgery Center</a>, a state-of-the-art outpatient surgical center located at 230 W. Maple Road in Troy. Dr. Vasileff also has operating privileges at <a href="https://www.beaumonthospitals.com/Locations-and-Visitor-Information-Royal-Oak-Hospital" onclick="window.open(this.href); return false;">William Beaumont Hospital</a> in Royal Oak.</p>

<p>If you require additional information, Dr. Vasileff is prepared to consult with you individually to provide meaningful details of your procedure and to answer each of your questions. If you choose to undergo a procedure, the committed and caring staff of Birmingham Institute of Plastic Surgery can then lead you through the process of making an appointment, scheduling your surgery, and perhaps most importantly, understanding the expectations of recovery.
