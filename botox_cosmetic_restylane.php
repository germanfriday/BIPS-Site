      <p>The cosmetic form of botulinum toxin, usually referred to by its product name Botox&reg;, is a non-surgical injection that reduces or eliminates frown lines, forehead creases, crows feet near the eyes and thick bands in the neck. The toxin blocks the nerve impulses, temporarily paralyzing the muscles that cause wrinkles while giving the skin a smoother, more refreshed appearance. Restylane is a crystal-clear, non-animal, biodegradable natural gel injected into the skin in small amounts to fill wrinkles, creases or depressions in different areas of the face. </p>
