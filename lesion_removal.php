      <p>Lesion removal uses a variety of techniques to remove a localized area of diseased, scarred or abnormal tissue. Sometimes the purpose of skin lesion removal is to excise an unsightly mole or other cosmetically unattractive skin growth. Other times a skin lesion may be removed to make certain it's not cancerous, and to prevent its spread to other areas of the body if it is cancerous.</p>
