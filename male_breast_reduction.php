                <p>Gynecomastia is a medical term that comes from the Greek words for 'female-like breasts'. This condition is rarely talked about but is actually quite common. It may affect one breast or both. For men who feel self-conscious about their appearance, breast-reduction surgery can help. The procedure removes fat and/or glandular tissue from the breasts, and in extreme cases removes excess skin, resulting in a chest that is flatter and better contoured. It can often be done with liposuction.</p>
