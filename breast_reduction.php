                <p>Breast reduction is designed to help women with very large, pendulous breasts who may experience a variety of medical problems caused by the excessive weight. The procedure removes fat, glandular tissue, and skin from the breasts, making them smaller, lighter, and firmer. It also reduces the size of the areola, the darker skin surrounding the nipple. The ideal result is smaller, better-shaped breasts more in proportion with the rest of the body.</p>
