                <p>An arm lift, also known as brachioplasty, is a surgical procedure that removes loose skin and excess fat deposits in the upper arm. With age, upper arm skin can become loose and flabby. Brachioplasty tightens this skin to provide a younger, firmer look. The scar is left on the inner aspect of the arm, toward the chest.</p>
