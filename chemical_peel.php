      <p>A chemical peel uses a chemical solution to improve and smooth the texture of the facial skin by removing its damaged outer layers. It is an effective procedure for facial blemishes, wrinkles and uneven skin pigmentation. Trichloroacetic acid, glycolic and alphahydroxy acids are used for this purpose and the precise formula used can be adjusted to meet your needs. Although a chemical peel may be performed in conjunction with a face lift, it is not a substitute for such surgery.</p>
