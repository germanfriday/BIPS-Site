                <p>Breast augmentation is a surgical procedure to enhance the size and shape of a woman's breasts for a variety of cosmetic reasons. It is also done to balance a difference in breast size, to improve body contour, or as a reconstructive procedure following surgery. By inserting a silicone gel, or saline, above or below the muscle, we can increase a woman's breast size by one or more bra cup sizes.</p>
