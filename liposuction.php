                <p>Liposuction can help sculpt the body by removing unwanted fat from specific areas, including the abdomen, hips, buttocks, thighs, knees, upper arms, chin, cheeks and neck. During the past decade liposuction has benefited from several new refinements. Today, a number of new techniques, including ultrasound-assisted lipoplasty, the tumescent technique, and power-assisted liposuction, are helping to provide selected patients with more precise results and quicker recovery times. Although no type of liposuction is a substitute for dieting and exercise, it can remove stubborn areas of fat that don't respond to traditional weight-loss methods. It is an excellent technique for body contouring, but not for weight lose.</p>
