                <p>This surgical procedure removes excess skin and fat from the middle and lower abdomen and to tighten the muscles of the abdominal wall. The procedure can dramatically reduce the appearance of a protruding abdomen. This is done through an incision that extends across the pubic, and up toward each hip. Liposuction of the hips and waist is often done at the same time. </p>
