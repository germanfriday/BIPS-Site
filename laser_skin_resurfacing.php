      <p>Laser skin resurfacing uses a laser to remove surface areas of damaged or wrinkled skin, layer by layer. The procedure is most commonly used to minimize the appearance of lines, especially around the mouth and the eyes. It is also effective in treating facial scars or areas of uneven pigmentation. Laser resurfacing may be performed on the whole face or in specific regions.</p>
