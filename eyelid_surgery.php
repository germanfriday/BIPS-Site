      <p>A Blepharoplasty, or eyelid surgery, is a procedure to remove skin, usually along with some excess fat from the upper and lower eyelids. Eyelid surgery can correct drooping upper lids and puffy bags below your eyes, features that make you look older and more tired than you feel, and may even interfere with your vision. Blepharoplasty can be done alone, or in conjunction with other facial surgery procedures.</p>
