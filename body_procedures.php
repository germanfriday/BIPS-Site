<p>One of the most common of all plastic surgery procedures is nose reshaping, or Rhinoplasty. Rhinoplasty can reduce the size of your nose, change the shape of the tip or the bridge, narrow the span of the nostrils, or change the angle between your nose and your upper lip. It may also correct a birth defect or injury, or help relieve some breathing problems.</p>
